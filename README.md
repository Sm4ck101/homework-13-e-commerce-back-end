# E-commerce Back End

## Description

This application is a back-end e-commerce site that displays a mySQL database. It uses Express, Sequelize and mySQL2 as its core dependencies. Once set up you are able to display API Routes through you're localhost to perform CRUD operations.

## Installation

The user should clone the repository and create a .gitignore and .env file to store your mysql login credentials and tie them to the config/connection.js file. You can use Insomnia to complete the CRUD request.

To use this application, you need to install the dependencies with the following commands:

npm install
npm install sequelize
npm install dotenv
npm install mysql2

To create the database, you must log in to MySQL and source db/schema.sql.

To seed the database, run 'npm start' from the command line.

## Usage

This application will allow users to view, add, edit, and delete categories, products, and tags through Insomnia or any other cross-platfrom desktop application.
